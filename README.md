Nim is a kind of game in which players take turn to removing objects
from some initial configuration. A particular version of the Nim is: there is a pile of
13 coins on the table, on each turn, players take either 1, 2, or 3 coins from the pile
and put them aside. The objective of the game is to avoid being forced to take the
last coin.
